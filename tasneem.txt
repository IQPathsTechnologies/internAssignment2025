Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹
My name is tasneem Khan, and Iâ€™m currently an intern at IQPaths Technologies. Iâ€™m excited to explore Git and GitHub through this task and look forward to contributing to innovative projects.

This file is part of my learning journey, where Iâ€™m honing my skills in version control, collaboration, and software development practices.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
